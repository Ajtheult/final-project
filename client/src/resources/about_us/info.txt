About 

Why did we start the business?
I wanted to spread my love for music as a whole. For this reason I decided to 
create a site where people can buy instruments and find themselves through music.
The creation of this site was inspired by, TwoSet Violin




Who is Ling Ling?

Ling Ling is a fictional and genderless character created by TwoSetViolin and 
is portrayed to be the best violinist in the world. They practice 40 hours a 
day, which is the equivalent of approximately 11.667 days a week. This has 
become a meme and is used frequently around the TwoSet fandom. They even 
named their subreddit, LingLing40hrs.The people that are appart of it are called "Ling Ling Wannabes"
