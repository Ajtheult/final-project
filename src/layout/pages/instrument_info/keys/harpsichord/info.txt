What is the harpsichord?

A harpsichord is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. Like a pipe organ, 
a harpsichord may have more than one keyboard manual and harpsichords may have stop buttons 
which add or remove additional octaves. Some harpsichords may have a lute stop, which simulates 
the sound of a plucked lute.
