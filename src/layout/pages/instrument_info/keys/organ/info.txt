a large musical instrument having rows of pipes supplied with air from bellows 
(now usually electrically powered), and played using a keyboard or by an automatic
mechanism. The pipes are generally arranged in ranks of a particular type, each 
controlled by a stop, and often into larger sets linked to separate keyboards.
