Type of instrument: Woodwind

What is the piccolo?

The piccolo is a half-size flute, and a member of the woodwind family 
of musical instruments. The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings 
as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it 
produces is an octave higher than written.
