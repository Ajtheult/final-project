(The EPIC and InTeReStInG history of how BASS gang vs Violin gang started) //Bass gang has the red B 

Writer: Asaph Franks

TwoSetViolin a Youtube channel run by two Asian males Brett and Eddy 
and centers around classical music, memes and the like made a video titled,
 "{name}" where they can you guess?...rated instruments. When they got to 
the electric bass they rated it an E for "EPIC"(one of Davie504's catch phrases). 
Davie504 is an Italian Youtuber whose channel centers around BASS and memes.
He watched that video and saw that they rated the bass an E when it's supposed 
to be in the S tier(//Recheck his video). Davie504 responded in that videos and 
then these two massive channels started going back and forth reacting to one 
another's responses and creating challenges for the other channel to complete. 
This banter is so that they are able enlarge their audience and give great content 
to everyone in this time of the pandemic. I have been apart of both of these 
communities and seeing these two channels interact is so...EPIC.
